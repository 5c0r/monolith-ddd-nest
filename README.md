## Introduction

This is a project that will try to reproduce [This project](https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd) . The original project was written in ASP.NET Core.

This is likely to see how things can be reproduced in Node.js , in this case I would like to give Nest.js a tryout. Since Nest.js by itself is a *set of libraries* which was combined to make things work together

The project is scaffolded using Nest.js CLI

## Functional TODO
